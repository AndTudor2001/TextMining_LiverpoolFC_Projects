Articles Report Liverpool FC

The theme of this project is to extract and analyze articles that mention or talk about the Liverpool FC football team, one of the most famous and best teams in football.
I will structure this report in three parts to capture the extraction steps, the types of analyzes selected and a brief summary of the results obtained.
1. The article extraction stage
  The draw was based on the articles related to the football team Liverpool FC, but to which we also added some parameters to give specificity to this type of project. The main parameters were:
• Chosen Theme: The articles were chosen by a specific keyword, namely Liverpool FC. I also chose the football section because it narrows the search and retrieval and eliminates situations where the team name may also appear in other sports, for example baseball or hockey (football team owners also own teams in these sports, and many articles contain phrases like patrons Liverpool football team, used as a clickbait method
• Temporal range: articles between 2009-03-20 and the present were retrieved, starting with the newest articles
• Number of articles: I chose to extract 200 articles because I wanted to get a large enough number to be able to capture the diversity of opinions and events.
2. Types of analysis
Within the project, we performed 5 types of analysis with the aim of providing multiple points of view on the content. All the analyzes performed were performed using the ChatGPT API. The 3 types of analysis are:
• Relevance analysis: We tried to see how relevant the articles stored in the relevant database are in relation to the topic of Liverpool FC. I wanted to look into this to see if the team name was used to drive views to the articles.
• Sentiment analysis: each article was analyzed in order to detect the general tone (negative, positive, neutral) in order to give me an overview of the tone of the media regarding the chosen topic
• Detection of controversial content: I tried to identify if an article contains controversial or polarizing content. I generally looked for sensitive topics or debates that offered hints of possible controversy
• Correlation between the relevance of the article and the author of that article
• Correlation between article sentiment and the author of that article


3. Brief analysis of the results
Following the analysis, the following ideas and perspectives were obtained on the extracted and analyzed articles:
• Degree of relevance: Most of the articles proved relevant to our topic, Liverpool FC
• Prevailing sentiments in the articles: in general, a positive and neutral tone prevails, suggesting a rather favorable perception of the team. This is also outlined by the results achieved by the team in the chosen time frame. More negative articles have also been identified, but these are due to injury or sale of players, as well as poor matches made by the team
• Controversial topics: the controversial topics identified in the 200 articles are those related to the decisions of the referees, the performance of the team or a player, the historical context of some matches, as well as discussions about injury problems
• Sentiment-author connection: we notice that, in general, the positive-neutral tone prevails, generally due to the performance of the players, but also of the coach. In general, some authors have a more positive tone, such as Andy Hunter, but also authors with a more negative tone, such as Nick Ames. The negative articles generally focused on the performance of the players or the team.
• Relevance-author connection: we notice that there is a connection between the relevance of the article in relation to our topic and the author of the article, for example the author Andy Hunter has a relevance average of 8.55, this suggests that he is the journalist dedicated to the team or even the area where he comes from team, Merseyside

As a brief conclusion, following the 200 articles extracted and analyzed about the Liverpool FC football team, I can say that we have obtained a detailed picture of how Liverpool FC is seen by The Guardian newspaper, noting the high degree of relevance between the football team and her name appeared in every article, the mostly positive-neutral tone, as well as the controversies encountered during the team's active and inactive periods.
